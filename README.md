# R-Basics
A series of projects to strengthen the fundamental programming aspects of R from John Hopkins Data Science Specialization courses with a few twists and turns. The objective of this repo is to track my progress as I develop my skills in R, as well as provide a constant reference to the skills that I developed over the Data Specialization courses.

Some of my earlier work was done through Jupyter Notebook due to my familiarity with it in Python, but soon after you will be able to find that all my work will be done through mostly R markdown files and some R scripts. 

For those that are interested in looking at the projects that I've completed, I've tried to output most of the latter material in `.md` format for ease of viewing on GitHub.

## Knowledge Summary

**R Programming**: The basics R language without add-ons or libraries. Datatypes, subsetting, control structures, functions, loop functions and simulation.

**Getting and Cleaning Data**: Principles of tidy data, reading local, excel, XML, and JSON files, reading from MySQL, HDF5, Web, and APIs, the  **DPLYR** and **TIDYR** packages, and working with dates.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Principles of Analtic Graphics, Exploratory graphs, Base Plotting System, Graphics Devices, Lattice Plotting System, **ggplot2** package, Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means Clustering, and Dimension Reduction (PCA and SVD)

**Reproducible Research**: Concept of reproducibility, Data Analysis Structures, Markdown, RMarkdown, **knitr** package, and best practices.

*The second project of this course offered a great opportunity to practice many of the skills that I've learned prior to Reproducible Research in a presentable manner.*
