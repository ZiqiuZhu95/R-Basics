# R-Basics
A series of projects to strengthen the fundamental programming aspects of R from John Hopkins Data Science Specialization courses with a few twists and turns. The objective of this repo is to track my progress as I develop my skills in R, as well as provide a constant reference to the skills that I developed over the Data Specialization courses.

Some of my earlier work was done through Jupyter Notebook due to my familiarity with it in Python, but soon after you will be able to find that all my work will be done through mostly R markdown files and some R scripts. 

For those that are interested in looking at the work that I've done, I suggest to simply look at the .md files that are available to look at via the web.
