## Reproducible Research

In this course, the fifth of ten courses in the Data Science Specialization, I learn the ideas of reproducible research and reporting of statistical analyses. Topics covered include literate programming tools, evidence-based data analysis, and organizing data analyses. I learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, publish reproducible documents to the web, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.

This course encompasses two projects, and their descriptions can be found in their respective folders.
