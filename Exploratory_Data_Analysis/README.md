This is the fourth course in the Data Science Specialization. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a key element of data science because it allows you to develop a rough idea of what your data look like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them.

There were two major projects in this course, of which both descriptions can be found under the `README.md`'s of both folders.
